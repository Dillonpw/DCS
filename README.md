# Dispatcher Cheat Sheet

## Introduction
The Dispatcher Cheat Sheet is a dynamic web application, initially conceived as a simple schedule app in vanilla JavaScript, and has since evolved into a multifunctional tool using Astro and TypeScript abd a few React Islands. As a 911 dispatcher, I developed this project out of personal necessity, and it has become an essential part of my daily routine. It's designed to scale and adapt as new functionalities are identified to streamline dispatcher tasks.

## Project Evolution
This project reflects my journey and growth as a developer. What began as a simple scheduling tool has transformed into a comprehensive aid, making everyday tasks more manageable and efficient for 911 dispatchers. I plan to continuously build upon this to meet the changing demands of dispatch work. The Project is currently being fitted for ads and will soon be distributed.
